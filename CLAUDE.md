# deps — project instructions

## Roadmap

This repo is governed by ROADMAP.md (pending work) and HISTORY.md (completed work).

- **Start here for context.** ROADMAP.md is the durable record of work that is established
  but unfinished. Read it rather than reconstructing the state of play from git history,
  old conversations, or a sweep of the code.
- Items are grouped **Now / Next / Later**. To choose what to work on, take the first item
  under the earliest horizon whose **Blocked-by** entries are no longer present in the file.
- When you finish an item: delete it from ROADMAP.md, add a line under today's date at the
  top of HISTORY.md recording the outcome **actually** achieved, and drop its ID from the
  **Blocked-by** list of every item it was blocking.
- When **Now** empties, promote the readiest items from **Next**, so the file keeps
  answering "what should I be doing" rather than going quiet.
- ROADMAP.md holds pending work only. Never mark an item done in place — removal is what
  "done" means here.

## Before starting a roadmap item

Read the relevant HISTORY.md entry first. Most items have a rejected design or a
measurement behind them, and the reasoning is the load-bearing part — HISTORY exists
because plausible ideas turned out to be wrong when they met real data.

The **Standing rules** at the top of ROADMAP.md are constraints, not aspirations. Each
one exists because breaking it produced a wrong answer. Judge every change against them.
